## Reconnaissance
- Reconnaisance is the process of observing and researching the target.
### Data Breach
- Here we can search about the target from data breaches, from sites like [LeakPeek](https://leakpeek.com/).
- Another tool is Social Hacker which can be used to hack into social media profiles (worth â‚¹2 cr.)  
## Zero Day Exploit
- Zero Day Exploits are vulnerabilities which have not been publicly known.
- Partial details about vulnerability may be possible
## Public Vulnerabilty
- Public Vulnerability are vulnerabilities which are known to public and/or owning organisation.
## Session hijacking
- It is the malicious act of collecting session information (cookies) from user and bypassing security procedures like password, otp, 2FA, etc.
- This is also called cookie hijacking
- Example - Facebook has a vulnerability which doesn't filter GIF, so an attacker stegnographed a payload into GIF which would extract the cookie information of the user from com.facebook.* and send it to attackers email. Then attacker would load that cookie information into his/her browser and would gain access to target's facebook account.
